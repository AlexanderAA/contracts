Introduction
============

This is an implementation of a simple financial contract language in
Haskell (see [Haskell](Haskell) subdirectory). The implementation is
accompanied by a Coq formalisation (see [Coq](Coq) subdirectory). The
Haskell implementation is based on previous implementation in Standard
ML (see [SML](SML) subdirectory).
